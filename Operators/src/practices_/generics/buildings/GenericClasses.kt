Check(argument) is a standard library function in kotlin, that's really
convenient for checking the state of your classes. It acts as an assertion
and it will throw an illegal exception if its argument is false

/*
Generic in and out
Out type are type parameters that only ever occur in return values of functions
or on val properties.
Out types can only be passed out of an object or returned.
There's one special time you can pass an out type. Contructors can take out types
as arguments, but functions never can
In types are from the same school as out types. Can be used anytime, the generic
is only used as an argument to funcitons. More specifically, in tupes
can only be passed into an object.
